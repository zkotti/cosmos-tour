# cosmos-tour-website

The guide you know and love, now in static website format powered by [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). [Access the web version](https://e-panourgia.github.io/cosmos-tour/) or build it yourself!

## Requirements

 - [Python >= 3.6](https://www.python.org/)
 - [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/)
 - [mkdocs-same-dir](https://github.com/oprypin/mkdocs-same-dir#mkdocs-same-dir)
 - [mkdocs-bootswatch](https://mkdocs.github.io/mkdocs-bootswatch/#installation-usage)

## Build

```
mkdocs build
```

## Contribute

- Edit only the build configuration file (mkdocs.yml) - not the built website, otherwise your changes will be lost on the next build.
- Add any new packages used to requirements.txt - and make sure that the minimum required Python version does not need to be updated as well.
- Keep the [Mkdocs user guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/) open in a browser tab - it's invaluable when working with Mkdocs!
